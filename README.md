After you donwloaded the archive, extract it anywhere you like
In the extracted folder, find absinthe icon, rightclick it, ---> select properties ---> compatibility
place tick in "Run this program in compatibility mode for", and select Windows XP(service pack 3) - Got no fucking idea, what's that for, but it does not work otherwise :D
Then, doubleclick absinthe icon, and wait for installation process to finish.

Latest version of iTunes needs to be installed on your PC!

Connect your device via usb cable, after that - run absinthe
Wait until absinthe recognizes your device, and then press "Jailbreak". Wait for process to finish(takes about 3-5 min),
and do not disconnect your device

========= stage 2: Preparing the device =============

After device is successfully "jailbroken", some software needs to be installed.
But first, we need to update Cydia's packages, which is going to be done automatically as soon as you enter it.
